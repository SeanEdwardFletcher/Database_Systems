## Installation

The only packages you will need to run this code are:

json
tqdm
sqlite3


## Steps to Run

The file ass03_main.py won't work unless you have the json file of arXiv paper information. That information belongs to my professor and I will not be sharing it here.

You can see how I parsed the information from the json file in order to populate the database.

The function in the build_db.py will run however and will set up all the tables I need. If you want to run this function, you can enter the name you would like to use for this database on line 6 in ass03_main.py.


## Conclusion

The queries work. Everything seems to run just fine.
