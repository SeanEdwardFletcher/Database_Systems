# A collection of MySQL queries, functions and procedures wrapped in Python functions

This is a class assignment where each function is run in main with print statements. The database they are accessing is a collection of data from www.imdb.com.

The .PDF file "Assignment 4" is the assignment description.

The .PDF file "DatabaseSystems_Assignment04writeUp_SeanFletcher" is my write up for the assignment. 

The JSON file is used so I'm not putting my database password here in github. 
The functions in the .py file call this file when accessing the database. 
In order to use any of the code you will need to put your credentials in a JSON file like this one.
